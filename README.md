# Calculator Web Application

A simple yet functional **Calculator Web Application** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app provides basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), percentage calculation, and features like backspace and voice recognition to enhance the user experience.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Percentage Calculation**: Calculates the percentage of a given number.
- **Clear and Backspace**: Allows clearing the screen or deleting the last character.
- **Voice Recognition**: Integrates with your device’s voice recognition to input numbers and operators by speaking.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to work on all screen sizes, including mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout design of the calculator interface.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the core logic and operations of the calculator, including button presses, calculations, and voice input functionality.

## How It Works
1. **Basic Operations**: You can input numbers and operators by clicking the respective buttons. Once you enter the equation, pressing `=` will display the result.
2. **Percentage Operation**: The `%` button allows you to calculate the percentage of a number (e.g., `20%`).
3. **Clear Button (`C`)**: Clears the screen and resets the equation.
4. **Backspace Button (`⌫`)**: Deletes the last character from the equation.
5. **Voice Input**: The app uses the browser's built-in Speech Recognition API to listen to spoken commands. By clicking the voice icon, you can dictate numbers and operators to perform calculations.
6. **Responsive Layout**: The calculator adapts to different screen sizes, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.
