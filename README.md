**Calculator Web Application**
A simple yet functional Calculator Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app provides basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), percentage calculation, and features like backspace and voice recognition to enhance the user experience.

Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Percentage Calculation: Calculates the percentage of a given number.
Clear and Backspace: Allows clearing the screen or deleting the last character.
Voice Recognition: Integrates with your device’s voice recognition to input numbers and operators by speaking.
Responsive Design: Designed to work on all screen sizes, including mobile devices.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the application.
CSS: Styling and layout design of the calculator interface.
JavaScript: Handles the core logic and operations of the calculator, including button presses, calculations, and voice input functionality.
How It Works
Basic Operations: You can input numbers and operators by clicking the respective buttons. Once you enter the equation, pressing = will display the result.
Percentage Operation: The % button allows you to calculate the percentage of a number (e.g., 20%).
Clear Button (C): Clears the screen and resets the equation.
Backspace Button (⌫): Deletes the last character from the equation.
Voice Input: The app uses the browser's built-in Speech Recognition API to listen to spoken commands. By clicking the voice icon, you can dictate numbers and operators to perform calculations.
Responsive Layout: The calculator adapts to different screen sizes, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.
